  - attitude: ~~cry then you success~~ always learn from others, discuss, throw yourself into what you're fascinated
  - If you're not coding in my dream, I would fail.
  - 학사 vs. 석사 vs. 박사
    - Bachelor: Now I know everything!
    - Master: What do I know?
    - Ph.D: I know nothing

- ROI(Region Of Interest)
  - ROI는 뜻 그대로 **이미지나 영상 내에서 내가 관심있는 부분**을 뜻한다. 이미지 상의 특정 오브젝트나 특이점을 찾는 것을 목표로 할 때 쓴다. (비슷한 용어로는 COI(Channel Of Interest)라는 관심 채널이 있다.) 2020. 11. 24.
